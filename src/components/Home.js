                The Sunset Drive-in was opened in 1951 and is a single screen, 500 car drive-in. It is one of the few remaining drive-ins still operating in Southern California. It was ranked as one of the top 10 remaining drive-ins in the United States by TripAdvisor. So if you are in the area, do yourself a favor and take in a movie there. It is open year round. The Sunset Drive-in is cash only and they do not have an ATM on site so make sure to bring plenty of cash for admission and the concession stand. Also, as is common with California drive-ins, they hold a swap meet on the grounds of the drive-in every Sunday opening at 6am.
